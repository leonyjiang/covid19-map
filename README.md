# Rhode Island COVID Map
This repository is no longer in use.

The map can be found [here](https://www.browndailyherald.com/sections/covid-19-update/). And here's the Observable [notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/4657a12be39e7ef6).

Huge thanks to @j-f1 for contributing to the visualization and handling deployment!
